General Usage
NOTE: All API URLs should use the domain api.kraken.com.

Public methods can use either GET or POST.

Private methods must use POST and be set up as follows:

HTTP header:

API-Key = API key
API-Sign = Message signature using HMAC-SHA512 of (URI path + SHA256(nonce + POST data)) and base64 decoded secret API key
POST data:

nonce = always increasing unsigned 64 bit integer
otp = two-factor password (if two-factor enabled, otherwise not required)
Note: There is no way to reset the nonce to a lower value so be sure to use a nonce generation method that won't generate numbers less than the previous nonce. A persistent counter or the current time in hundredths of a second precision or higher is suggested. Too many requests with nonces below the last valid nonce (EAPI:Invalid nonce) can result in temporary bans.

Note: Sometimes requests can arrive out of order or NTP can cause your clock to rewind, resulting in nonce issues. If you encounter this issue, you can change the nonce window in your account API settings page. The amount to set it to depends upon how you increment the nonce. Depending on your connectivity, a setting that would accomodate 3-15 seconds of network issues is suggested.

API calls that require currency assets can be referenced using their ISO4217-A3 names in the case of ISO registered names, their 3 letter commonly used names in the case of unregistered names, or their X-ISO4217-A3 code (see http://www.ifex-project.org/).

Responses are JSON encoded in the form of:

error = array of error messages in the format of:
    <char-severity code><string-error category>:<string-error type>[:<string-extra info>]
    severity code can be E for error or W for warning
result = result of API call (may not be present if errors occur)
Note: Care should be taken when handling any numbers represented as strings, as these may overflow standard data types.

API call rate limit
We have safeguards in place to protect against abuse/DoS attacks as well as order book manipulation caused by the rapid placing and canceling of orders.

Every user of our API has a "call counter" which starts at 0.

Ledger/trade history calls increase the counter by 2.

Place/cancel order calls do not affect the counter.

All other API calls increase the counter by 1.

The user's counter is reduced every couple of seconds, and if the counter exceeds the user's maximum API access is suspended for 15 minutes. Tier 2 users have a maximum of 15 and their count gets reduced by 1 every 3 seconds. Tier 3 and 4 users have a maximum of 20; the count is reduced by 1 every 2 seconds for tier 3 users, and is reduced by 1 every 1 second for tier 4 users.

Although placing and cancelling orders does not increase the counter, there are separate limits in place to prevent order book manipulation. Only placing orders you intend to fill and keeping the rate down to 1 per second is generally enough to not hit this limit.

EOrder:Cannot open opposing position
EOrder:Margin allowance exceeded
EOrder:Margin level too low
EOrder:Insufficient margin (exchange does not have sufficient funds to allow margin trading)
EOrder:Insufficient funds (insufficient user funds)
EOrder:Order minimum not met (volume too low)
EOrder:Orders limit exceeded
EOrder:Positions limit exceeded
EOrder:Rate limit exceeded
EOrder:Scheduled orders limit exceeded
EOrder:Unknown position
Note:

See Get tradable asset pairs for specifications on asset pair prices, lots, and leverage.
Prices can be preceded by +, -, or # to signify the price as a relative amount (with the exception of trailing stops, which are always relative). + adds the amount to the current offered price. - subtracts the amount from the current offered price. # will either add or subtract the amount to the current offered price, depending on the type and order type used. Relative prices can be suffixed with a % to signify the relative amount as a percentage of the offered price.
For orders using leverage, 0 can be used for the volume to auto-fill the volume needed to close out your position.
If you receive the error "EOrder:Trading agreement required", refer to your API key management page for further details.
Cancel open order

Input:

txid = transaction id
Result:

count = number of orders canceled
pending = if set, order(s) is/are pending cancellation
Note: txid may be a user reference id.

PHP
The Kraken team has provided a basic PHP library for interfacing with the Kraken REST API. The source and usage examples are also available on Payward's kraken-api-client github repository and is MIT licensed.

Library
Use this library class to make calls to the Kraken REST API with a PHP client. It automatically determines the API method's correct URL path, generates a nonce for each request, and adds a signed header using your API secret and the generated nonce.

Example usage

Below are the steps involved in initializing the KrakenAPI library class, as well a number of example API method calls. Formatted result sets are shown beneath each respective API call snippet.

Initialization

Include the library file and supply your API key and secret when instantiating a KrakenAPI object.

<?php

require_once 'KrakenAPIClient.php';
$kraken = new KrakenAPI('YOUR API KEY', 'YOUR API SECRET');
Method calls

Query a public list of active assets and their properties:

$res = $kraken->QueryPublic('Assets');
print_r($res);
Returned assets are keyed by their ISO-4217-A3-X names, example output:

Query public recent trades for XBT/EUR pair since 2013-08-07T18:20:42+00:00:
